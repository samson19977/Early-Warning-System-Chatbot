Early Warning System Chatbot
The Early Warning System Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to predict air pollution levels in Rwanda using machine learning models. It provides real-time alerts, health recommendations, and action steps to help individuals, communities, and policymakers take preventive measures against harmful air quality. This system helps to mitigate health risks related to air pollution exposure, especially for vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions.

How It Works
This chatbot integrates machine learning models trained on historical air quality data, including pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3. It processes real-time data inputs, making predictions about future air pollution levels, and provides users with timely alerts based on these predictions.

Key Features:

Real-time Air Quality Forecasting: The chatbot predicts short-term and long-term air pollution levels based on weather patterns, historical data, and pollutant concentration.
Health Recommendations: Based on predicted air quality levels, the chatbot provides health guidance, suggesting whether outdoor activities are safe or advising users to limit exposure depending on the severity of pollution.
Geographic Customization: The chatbot offers predictions tailored to different regions in Rwanda, considering rural and urban differences in air quality.
Problems It Solves
The Early Warning System Chatbot addresses several critical issues related to air pollution:

Public Health Risks: Air pollution is a leading cause of respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths. This system helps people make informed decisions to protect their health.
Data-Driven Policy Support: By providing accurate predictions, the chatbot assists policymakers and local authorities in planning interventions and setting air quality standards for public health protection.
Lack of Awareness: Many people are unaware of the risks of poor air quality. The chatbot raises awareness by providing real-time information and educational content about air pollution.
Limited Monitoring in Rural Areas: The chatbot leverages data from rural regions, helping fill the gaps in air quality monitoring and offering relevant alerts to rural communities where such data is often scarce.
Installation
To set up the chatbot on your local machine, you need to install the necessary dependencies. First, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Early-Warning-System-Chatbot.git
cd Early-Warning-System-Chatbot
Install Dependencies
This project uses several Python libraries for machine learning, data processing, and chatbot integration. To install them, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Chatbot
After installing the dependencies, you can run the chatbot with the following command:

Air Pollution Forecasting: Predicts pollution levels for various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3.
Health Recommendations: Provides guidelines for outdoor activities based on air quality.
Real-Time Alerts: Sends alerts to users when air pollution exceeds safe thresholds.
Customizable for Regions: The system can be customized to give specific alerts for different regions in Rwanda, considering varying air quality levels across urban and rural areas.
Usage
After cloning and setting up the repository, run the chatbot on your local machine.
Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple interface, asking questions related to air quality or health advice.
The chatbot will return real-time predictions, alerts, and health recommendations based on the air pollution levels in the specified region.
Example Interaction
User: "What's the air quality like in Kigali today?"

Chatbot: "Today's air quality in Kigali is PM2.5: 45 µg/m³, which is considered 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.' It's recommended that sensitive individuals, like children or the elderly, limit prolonged outdoor activities."

User: "Should I go for a walk today?"

Chatbot: "It is advisable to limit outdoor activities today due to the current air quality in Kigali. If you belong to a sensitive group, staying indoors would be safer."
